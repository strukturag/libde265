libde265 - open h.265 codec implementation
==========================================

libde265 is an open source implementation of the h.265 video codec.
It is written from scratch in plain C for simplicity and efficiency.
Its simple API makes it easy to integrate it into other software.

Currently, libde265 decodes I- and P- slices, B-slices decoding
is under construction. Encoding is planned to be added afterwards.


The library comes with two example programs:

- dec265, a simple player for raw h.265 bitstreams.
          It serves nicely as an example program how to use libde265.

- sherlock265, a Qt-based video player with the additional capability
          to overlay some graphical representations of the h.265
          bitstream (like CU-trees, intra-prediction modes).

Example bitstreams can be found, e.g., at this site:
  ftp://ftp.kw.bbc.co.uk/hevc/hm-10.1-anchors/bitstreams/lp_main/



Building
========

If you got libde265 from the git repository, you will first need to run
the included "autogen.sh" script to generate the "configure" script.

libde265 has no dependencies on other libraries, but both example programs
require that you install the libvideogfx library, which you can get from
  http://www.dirk-farin.net/software/libvideogfx/index.html
or
  http://sourceforge.net/p/libvideogfx/code/260/tree/trunk/libvideogfx/

You can disable building of the example programs by running ./configure with
  --disable-dec265        Do not dec265 decoder program.
  --disable-sherlock265   Do not build sherlock265 visual inspection program.

Additional logging information can be turned on and off using these ./configure flags:
  --enable-log-error      turn on logging at error level (default=yes)
  --enable-log-info       turn on logging at info level (default=no)
  --enable-log-trace      turn on logging at trace level (default=no)
